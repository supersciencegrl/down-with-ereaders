# Down with eReaders! 
Chrome extension that redirects epdf, epub, and reader urls to pdf. 

This extension reloads urls to those annoying e-reader/epdfs from publishers of journals like Wiley, AAAS, and PNAS. There may be issues with it; if so please either send a pull request or if you're not sure how to fix, just contact me.
